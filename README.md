ðŸ“– Project Overview
The goal of this project is to detect motion using a PIR sensor and respond by turning an LED on or off. When motion is detected, the LED lights up, and a message is printed to the serial monitor. This setup is ideal for basic motion detection applications, such as security systems or automated lighting.
